			<p class="abouttext">My name is Lauren Stipp. I am currently a transfer student at Illinois State University. I am majoring in Creative Technology with an emphasis in Game Design.
			While in high school I took duel credit classes through Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. The classes were there Parkland's ECCA (Early College and Career Academy) in the Computer Networking program.
		 	Enrolling into ECCA helped me move forward into the career field I wanted to work since I was in junior high.</p>

			<p class="abouttext">During my courses, I have created at least four games. In my spare time, I am thinking of new games to create. My main skill in game development would be programming. I have other skills that help me develop games such
			as art. I am not a trained artist but I am teaching myself on how to make art that will suit the game I am working on. The least amount of skill I have would be in sound design. In the upcoming semesters I would be taking a sound design classes
			which is a requirement to graduate. By the time I graduate I will be well rounded in many skills that will help me develop games in the future.</p>
